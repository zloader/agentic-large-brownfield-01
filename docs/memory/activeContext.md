## 1. Introduction

This file is a living record of the **current project context** for the Excalidraw monorepo. It captures the most recent and relevant information that influences day-to-day development, debugging, and decision-making. Use it to:

- **Onboard** new contributors quickly without archaeology through git history.
- **Debug** by knowing what changed recently and what the known failure modes are.
- **Align** across teams (frontend, QA, DevOps, product) on the current state of the project.

It complements the static reference docs in `docs/memory/` (see `techContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `decisionLog.md`). Those describe *what the system is*; this document describes *what is happening right now*.

## 3. Ongoing Work

### Active

- **Documentation layer build-out** *(in progress)*
  - All core memory docs (`projectbrief`, `productContext`, `systemPatterns`, `techContext`, `decisionLog`) have been created in this sprint.
  - `activeContext.md` (this file) is the final planned doc in the memory layer.
  - `docs/scopes/` already contains `application.scope.md`, `packages.scope.md`, and `project.scope.md` (Repomix-generated scope snapshots).

### Planned / Not Yet Started

- **Technical debt remediation** — `decisionLog.md` surfaced multiple `FIXME`/`TODO` items (see §4 and §5 below). No tickets yet assigned; prioritization needed.
- **`Scene.getScene()` singleton removal** — tracked as a TODO by `dwelle` and `mtolmacs` inside `packages/element/src/elbowArrow.ts`. Requires broader refactor of element-to-scene lookup.
- **Library localStorage migration adapter cleanup** — migration adapter shipped `2024-03-11`; the `// TODO maybe remove this in several months` comment is now >1 year overdue.

### Dependencies & Blockers

- Collaboration server (Socket.IO relay), Firebase project, and AI API endpoint are **externally operated** — any work on real-time or cloud features requires coordination with those service owners.
- The `packages/` build order (`common → math → element → excalidraw`) is a hard dependency: running `yarn build:packages` must complete before `excalidraw-app` can build.

## 4. Known Issues & Incidents

| ID | Issue | Impact | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| KI-001 | `isElementInFrame` is O(n) — iterates all elements per call with no cache | **High** — render jank / frame drop in scenes with 500+ elements in frames (drag ops worst case) | Open / No fix scheduled | `packages/element/src/frame.ts` line 752. Marked `// TODO: this a huge bottleneck for large scenes, optimise` |
| KI-002 | `UIOptions` normalization creates a new object on every parent render, busting memoization for all memoized toolbar/panel children | **Medium** — unnecessary re-renders in high-frequency scenarios (collab, animations) | Open | `packages/excalidraw` — FIXME comment. Incorrect memoization boundary. |
| KI-003 | Theme change detection is piggybacked on element-mutation Store listener, causing thousands of spurious theme comparisons per session | **Medium** — performance regression in text-heavy sessions; also causes a brief visual flash if theme changes with no concurrent mutations | Open | Workaround for missing Store event type. FIXME comment in source. |
| KI-004 | `isSomeElementSelected` utility holds global state that should be instance-scoped | **Low–Medium** — breaks isolation between multiple `<Excalidraw />` instances on same page | Open | `packages/excalidraw` — FIXME: `move this into the editor instance` |
| KI-005 | `LocalData.pauseSave("collaboration")` may not resume on error paths during collab startup | **Medium** — if collaboration startup throws mid-sequence, auto-save remains paused indefinitely for the session | Open | `excalidraw-app/collab/Collab.tsx` — no `try/finally` guard |
| KI-006 | Element deletion during delta-sync sets `isDeleted: true` and tracks `originalText`, which is acknowledged as a design violation breaking versioning | **Medium** — can cause stale data in collaborative sessions | Open | `// TODO: we should not do this since it breaks sync / versioning` |
| KI-007 | `positionElementsOnGrid` is acknowledged as low-quality (`// TODO rewrite (mostly vibe-coded)`) | **Low** — potential correctness issues in grid snapping edge cases | Open | `packages/element/src/` |

## 5. Recent Debugging Insights

### Collaboration State is Implicit — No Single State Object

Discovered while documenting `decisionLog.md`. The collaboration session lifecycle in `excalidraw-app/collab/Collab.tsx` has **no explicit state machine**. Session state is inferred from a combination of:
- Jotai atoms: `isCollaboratingAtom`, `collabErrorIndicatorAtom`
- Instance flags: `portal.socketInitialized`, `isSyncing`

**Key non-obvious transition:** `CONNECTING → CONNECTED` is only confirmed after the server emits an `"init-room"` message setting `portal.socketInitialized = true`. This is the single gate — missing it means the app silently thinks it's connected when it isn't.

**`restoreElements()` order matters:** It runs *before* reconciliation (not after), because running it post-reconciliation regenerates ephemeral state like `appState.newElement`, breaking in-progress drawing strokes.

### Touch/Wheel Event Listener Placement is Non-Negotiable

`touchstart` and `wheel` events must be attached in the **canvas ref callback** (not `componentDidMount` or `useEffect`). React 17+ makes all event listeners passive by default, preventing `preventDefault()`. The ref callback fires synchronously and is the only safe attachment point. Deviating from this pattern will silently break pinch-zoom and scroll prevention on mobile/trackpad.

### Bind Mode Timer — Hidden Timing Risk

The `bindModeHandler` in `App.tsx` is a bare `setTimeout` stored as an instance property. The transition from `BIND_MODE` back to `SELECTION` is time-driven, not event-driven. Under GC pauses or heavy CPU load, the timer fires late, potentially binding an arrow to an unintended target. No mitigation exists; be aware during debugging of unexpected binding behavior.

## 6. Team Knowledge & Decisions

| Date | Decision | Rationale | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|
| (pre-existing) | **Jotai over Redux** for state management | Eliminates boilerplate; atomic granularity avoids over-renders; `jotai-scope` isolates multiple `<Excalidraw />` instances | Core team |
| (pre-existing) | **No SSR — client-side only** | Canvas API and Web Crypto API are browser-only; SSR adds complexity with no benefit | Core team |
| (pre-existing) | **Servers act as dumb relays** — all encryption and reconciliation on the client | Security: servers never see plaintext diagram data; simplifies backend ops | Core team |
| (pre-existing) | **Two-canvas architecture** — `StaticCanvas` (scene) + `InteractiveCanvas` (selection/cursors) | Avoids repainting the full scene on every cursor move or selection change | Core team |
| (pre-existing) | **Immutable element snapshots + delta increments** in the Store | Enables undo/redo, conflict-free reconciliation, and efficient collab sync | Core team |
| (pre-existing) | **Offline-first** — localStorage + IndexedDB as primary persistence | App must be fully functional without network; cloud is additive | Core team |
| 2026-03-28 | **Documentation sprint before feature work** — build a full memory layer before resuming feature development | Reduces onboarding friction and surfaces hidden assumptions before new changes layer on top | Yevhen Moskalov |

## 7. Configuration & Environment Notes

### Local Development

```bash
# Install (Node ≥ 18.0.0 required)
yarn install

# Start dev server (excalidraw-app only)
yarn start          # → http://localhost:3000

# Build packages first if working on package code
yarn build:packages && yarn start

# Full test suite
yarn test:all
```

### Docker

```bash
docker-compose up   # → http://localhost:3000  (NODE_ENV=development)
```
- Container: `excalidraw` · Port mapping: `3000:80`
- Source is volume-mounted (`delegated`); `node_modules` are isolated in a named volume (`notused`).
- `restart: on-failure` — container auto-restarts on crash.

### Environment Variables (excalidraw-app)

The following env vars control feature behaviour. Set in `.env.local` for local dev (never commit):

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `VITE_APP_FIREBASE_CONFIG` | Firebase project config JSON (collab + cloud persistence) |
| `VITE_APP_AI_BACKEND` | AI/TTD API endpoint URL |
| `VITE_APP_WS_SERVER_URL` | WebSocket collaboration server URL |
| `VITE_APP_DISABLE_SENTRY` | Set to `true` to suppress error reporting locally |

### Known Environment Caveats

- **Firebase emulator not configured** — local dev hits the real Firebase project unless manually overridden. Avoid destructive operations on shared rooms during dev.
- **Collaboration server is external** — there is no local collab server setup in this repo. Real-time collab features require a running Socket.IO relay.
- **Docker build slow on M-series Macs** — the `delegated` volume mount mitigates I/O overhead but initial `yarn install` inside the container can take 3–5 min.
- **PWA service worker** — disabled in dev (`vite-plugin-pwa` dev mode). Enable explicitly if testing offline behaviour.

## 8. Monitoring & Observability Alerts

> ⚠️ No active production monitoring dashboards are configured in this repository. The following are **known risk areas** to watch:

- **Large scene performance** — `isElementInFrame` O(n) scan (KI-001). Watch for frame drop reports from users with complex, frame-heavy diagrams. No dashboard metric exists yet.
- **Collaboration error rate** — `collabErrorIndicatorAtom` drives the in-app error badge. Sentry integration (`excalidraw-app/sentry.ts`) is opt-in and may be disabled in some environments.
- **Auto-save silent pause** (KI-005) — if users report "my work wasn't saved" after a failed collaboration attempt, the `pauseSave` leak is the first suspect.
- **Firebase quota** — shared Firebase project used across local dev and production. Monitor usage if load testing or running automated tests against the real project.

### Recommended Future Alerts

- [ ] Error rate on `portal.socketInitialized` timeout (collab connect failures)
- [ ] P95 render time on scenes > 200 elements
- [ ] Failed `saveCollabRoomToFirebase` calls (silent data-loss risk)

## 9. Upcoming Work & Roadmap

> Items are directional — not yet formally scheduled. Derived from `decisionLog.md`, `PRD.md`, and open TODOs in code.

### Near-Term (next sprint)

- **Prioritize and ticket the technical debt** surfaced in `decisionLog.md` — at minimum assign owners to KI-001 through KI-007.
- **Remove the library migration adapter** (overdue since 2024-03-11; KI-007 equivalent in `excalidraw-app/App.tsx`).
- **Review `Scene.getScene()` removal plan** with `dwelle` / `mtolmacs` — this is a prerequisite for several element-layer cleanups.

### Medium-Term

- **`isElementInFrame` optimisation** (KI-001) — introduce a spatial index or dirty-flag cache for frame membership lookups.
- **`UIOptions` memoization fix** (KI-002) — move normalization to a stable `useMemo` or factory outside the render cycle.
- **Explicit collaboration state machine** — consider introducing an `xstate` machine or equivalent to replace the implicit atom + flag approach in `Collab.tsx`.
- **Store event system expansion** — add discrete theme-change events to avoid the mutation-listener workaround (KI-003).

### Longer-Term / Strategic

- **Package versioning** — move `@excalidraw/common`, `@excalidraw/element`, `@excalidraw/math`, `@excalidraw/utils` to independent semantic versioning for downstream consumers.
- **AI feature maturation** — TTD (Text-to-Diagram) and Diagram-to-Code are early-stage; roadmap includes improving Mermaid auto-fix reliability and expanding AI chat history persistence.
- **Accessibility audit** — formal WCAG 2.1 AA pass across the canvas interactions and toolbar.
